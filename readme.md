# Image Gallery with Darken/Lighten Effect

Hey! Welcome to this super simple image gallery. It lets you click on small thumbnails to view full-size images, and there’s also a fun button to toggle a darken/lighten effect on the main image. Just a cool way to showcase images with a little extra flair!

## What’s Inside:
- Click on any thumbnail to see the image in full-size.
- A button that lets you toggle a dark overlay on the image for that moody effect (click again to make it go away).
